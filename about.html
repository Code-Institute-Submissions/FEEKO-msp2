    Ever since Young M.A set the streets on fire with her introductory blazer “OOOUUU,” the Brooklyn-bred rapper-slash-entrepreneur has checked items off a bucket list that most dream about. However, with the sunshine comes the rain, and M.A is geared to tell all on her long-awaited debut album Herstory In The Making.

    Raised in Bed-Stuy—within walking distance of Jay-Z and the late Notorious B.I.G.’s stomping grounds—M.A learned a lot in her formative years. The streets called her early, though losing her brother to gun violence forced M.A into a hard pivot that would change her life forever. After checking the temperature for her music through a handful of rough loosie cuts, she finally dropped off “OOOUUU” in 2016 and it wasn’t long before she became a household name—landing coverage everywhere from Vogue to New York Times, as well as global ad campaigns with Google Pixel 2 and Beats By Dre.
    
    “A lot of new experiences have happened for me,” the young artist admits. “I came from the streets and building my own fan base. </p>

     have showed love through millions over social media and sold out shows, along with legends like Remy Ma bringing M.A out at Hot 97’s Summer Jam 2017 alongside other female rap greats. “There’s been a lot of opportunities, and of course a lot of money,” M.A says. “But then there’s the downside: you lose a lot of people that were once around you once their true colors start to show.” With Herstory In The Making, M.A has returned to her core, reflecting on the ups and downs of her now semi-charmed life. “I had to snap back into reality and remember what I was doing this for in the first place,” she reflects. “I had to bring it back to myself.”
    
    Herstory In the Making has taken on multiple forms since M.A first devised the concept years back. “I just felt like I needed more to talk about,” she says. “I wanted to drop the album, but people were pulling me in all different directions. I felt like I didn’t even have time to create it, because I was stuck in the limelight and trying to understand the business. I finally had to get a breath of fresh air and focus on this music.” The product is no holds barred.
    
    “You’re gonna get the truth,” M.A explains of Herstory. “You’re gonna get the cocky joints, the slick talk joints where I talk my talk,</p>
